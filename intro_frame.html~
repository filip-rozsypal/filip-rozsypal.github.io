	Welcome!<br/><br/>

 <br/>
 
I am a macroeconomist, with a general interest in macroeconomic dynamics. In particular, I am interested in the role of expectations and heterogeneity for business cycle fluctuations. I am also interested in solution methods for economic models.
 <br/>
I am on the academic job market this year. I will be available for interviews at ASSA meeting in Chicago, RES meeting in London and SAEe in Bilbao.
