I am interested in macroeconomics, in particular in business cycles, role of information and learning, the role of heterogeneity in determining aggregate outcomes. Such models often pose specific computational challenges and require development of new tools.

	<strong>Schumpeterian business cycles</strong> (Job Market Paper)<br />
This paper presents an economy where business cycles and long term growth are  both endogenously generated by the same type of iid shocks. I embed a multi-sector real business cycle model into an endogenous growth framework where innovating firms replace incumbent production firms. The only source of uncertainty is the imperfectly observed quality of innovation projects. As long as the goods are complements, a successful innovation in one sector increases demand for the output of other sectors. Higher profits motivate higher innovation efforts in the other sectors. The increase in productivity in one sector is thus followed by increases in productivity in the other sectors and the initial innovation generates persistent movement in aggregate productivity.

			<i>The Optimal Monetary Policy Rule: the Role of Asymmetries and Reputation </i>(<a href="ReputationAndAsymmetry2013.pdf" onClick="javascript: _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', 'paper Asymmetry and Reputation']);">link</a>) <br />

I study the optimal policy rule of a central bank under an asymmetric information and
reputation building setting. I find that the optimal reaction function is nonlinear, despite a
standard quadratic loss function and linear Phillips curve. The asymmetry arises from the
signal extraction problem of the agents. Given this setting, I analyze the propositions of
Rogoff and Blinder how to solve inflationary bias. I find that in the both cases the optimal
policy function is nonlinear. Furthermore, the Blinder setting delivers higher value of social
welfare.
