Welcome!

I am on the Job Market and I will be available for interviews at the AEA conference in Boston and the RES meeting in London.  <br/><br/>

I am a macroeconomist, with a general interest in macroeconomic dynamics. In particular, I am interested in business cycle fluctuations from the perspective of how disaggregated factors can lead to the emergence of aggregate phenomena.
