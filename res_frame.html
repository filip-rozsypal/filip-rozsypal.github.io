      I am interested in macroeconomics, in particular in business cycles, in the role of information, expectations and learning, and in the role of heterogeneity in determining aggregate outcomes. Such models often pose specific computational challenges and require the development of new tools.

We use a new registry micro level data set to study firm dynamics in Denmark. A unique feature of the data allows us to gain more information about older firms (operating for 30+ years), and an important proportion of these firms shows deteriorating productivity and rising exit rates. We find supportive evidence for other US-based stylized facts, such as young firms being more likely to exit and to grow faster over time. However, it seems to take longer for Danish firms to reach maturity. The Danish data also do not show any signs of a slowdown in the entry rate. Finally, we do not find long-run scarring effects on firms entering in recessions. However, fluctuations in the entry rate have persistent effects on the long-run aggregate volume of value added.

	      Using micro level data, we document a systematic, income-related component in household income forecast errors. We show that these errors can be formalized by a modest deviation from rational expectations, where agents overestimate the persistence of their income process but otherwise form expectations in a perfectly rational and forward-looking manner. We then investigate the implications of these distortions in expectations on consumption and saving behavior and find two effects. First, low income households with this bias are too pessimistic and hence choose to borrow less than their fully rational counterparts even though their borrowing constraint is not binding. This allows a quantitative model to match the joint distribution of liquid assets and income. Second, the bias alters the distribution of marginal propensities to consume which makes government stimulus policies less effective.

	      This paper presents an economy where business cycles and long term growth are both endogenously generated by the same type of iid shocks. I embed a multi-sector real business cycle model into an endogenous growth framework where innovating firms replace incumbent production firms. The only source of uncertainty is the imperfectly observed quality of innovation projects. As long as the goods are complements, a successful innovation in one sector increases demand for the output of other sectors. Higher profits motivate higher innovation efforts in the other sectors. The increase in productivity in one sector is thus followed by increases in productivity in the other sectors and the initial innovation generates persistent movement in aggregate productivity.

	      This note describes how a projection algorithm can be extended to solve dynamic stochastic
	      equilibrium models of high dimensionality which feature several types of agents and non-smooth dynamics. I show how this framework can be applied to solve a multi-sector business cycle model with endogenous growth.

	      I study the optimal policy rule of a central bank under an asymmetric information and reputation building setting. I find that the optimal reaction function is nonlinear, despite a standard quadratic loss function and linear Phillips curve. The asymmetry arises from the signal extraction problem of the agents. Given this setting, I analyze the propositions of Rogoff and Blinder how to solve inflationary bias. I find that in the both cases the optimal policy function is nonlinear. Furthermore, the Blinder setting delivers higher value of social welfare.<br/><br/>
